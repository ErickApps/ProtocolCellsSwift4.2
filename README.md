#    How to Avoid Multiple CellÂ Casting
                         
Multiple cell casting is probably the biggest reason for a massive view controller. 
I have searched the internet extensively and all I found was a not so massive view controller.

I found a way to reduce the amout of code when dealing with cells by using protocols.

I hope you like it!
